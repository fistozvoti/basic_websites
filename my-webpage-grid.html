        Taking it back, the Tatars were far from being uncivilized barbarians. For instance, they had a sophisticated administrative system that allowed them to rule their lands effectively.

        <li>The building was designed as the result of a public competition, the winning architects being Messrs Harry Austin Reid and Frederick George Green, with the contractors being Messrs T. Howard and F. G. Scott. Much of the building material, including fixtures and fittings was imported from Europe.</li>
        <li>The City Hall's carillon was installed as a World War I war memorial, with 22 additional bells being added in 1925 with the visit of the Prince of Wales.</li>

        <p>
        <li>Built between 1666 and 1679, the Castle is known as the oldest surviving building in South Africa and has been the centre of civilian, political and military life at the Cape from approximately 1679.</li>
        <li>Inside the Castle walls there were among others a church, bakery, workshops, living quarters, offices, cells and numerous other facilities.</li>
        <li>The Castle was, however, not the first fort to be built at the Cape. A quadrangular (four-pointed) fort was built after the arrival of Jan van Riebeeck in 1652 where the Grand Parade and the main Post Office are situated today. This fort was completed towards the end of 1653 and its inner structures in 1656. However, constant problems were experienced: The walls of the fort, which were constructed mainly of clay, collapsed and required constant repairs.  A model of this original fort can be seen in the Castle Military Museum.</li>

        <li>The museum's goal is to join people into a community where there is respect for dignity, identity and the co-existence of different races.</li>
